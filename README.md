# Python3-studies

Hi there!

I will upload all my learning projects here first off Ill try a course of 12 beginners project i found on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg

Im going to skip the madlibs project tho, not my cup of tea.

Feedback is much appreciated but I'd like to do it my own way first so that I can try and think out the program on my own first, I believe this is rather important to really learn. When a project is done please tell anything and everything that could be done better.
