# Python3-studies

YEAH IM LEARNING PYTHON HOPEFULLY THEREFOR PLEASE DO NOT USE MY CODE IT MIGHT CAUSE HARM TO YOUR SHIT AND SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

Any feedback is extremly welcome and appreciated but please refrain from helping me to much when I'm working on a learning project.
However when I've reached a conclution on a project please inform me on how my code can be better and stuff that I should concider for future projects.

If anyone wants to come in contact with me I have discord and an email of course but its ill managed and your mail might be lost in the avalanche of advertisment, penisbills and broods wanting to suck me of if I just click this one link.
